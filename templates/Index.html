    Hello and welcome to our Project we call it 
    <span class="sp">!! The Demonstrator !!</span><br>
    <pre>

    This project is a practical demonstration of how user's information is secured by a website.
    Securing user's information doesn't only include the use of strong passwords by the user or two step verification but instead


    <span class="sp">It also includes the following things:</span>
      <span class="highlight">
                  â€¢ The protocol used while exchange of data from the server to website to a client

                  â€¢ How the password is stored in a database

                  â€¢ How the data is retrieved from the database to server

                  â€¢ And finally, how the data is retrieved from the server to the client
      </span>
    There are obviously many more things to be considered
    to maintain the security integrity and reliability of data
    
    We are living in a modern world in which data breaches occur more often than the change in ruling party in a government.
    And in this world, internet addiction is more than the alcoholic addiction
    <span class="highlight">
    This means the data needs to be Garden 24/7 without any mistake
    But the truth is humans make mistakes (vice versa) ðŸ˜… it's in human nature.
